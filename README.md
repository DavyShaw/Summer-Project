# Summer-Project
## Dublin Bus Travel Time Prediction Application

This project was developed during the summer research period of my MSc. This project was completed as part of a team consisting of myself, Claudia Kinsella, Aongus Bates and Chen Zeng. 

The application fulfills a number of functions in its operations:
- Analyses data consisting of the arrival times of buses at specific bus stops throughout Dublin.
- From this it displays selected information of the accompanying Google Map.
- Once the user has made their selections, the application outputs an estimation of the travel time between the two spots.

## Application Screenshots
- Upon loading the web page the user is able to pinpoint their exact location as well as the nearest bus stops within 100 meters of their location. In addtion, extra data is provided such as the current time and weather condition which are used in the travel time prediction.

- Once the user has selected a route and the direction they wish to travel from the dropdown, the map updates displaying the route and the relevant stops. This allows the user to select the stops they wish to travel to and from and provide a geographical representation of these.

- Once a user has selected all the options for their journey, the application will run the selections through the data model and output the estimated journey time.
