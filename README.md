# Summer-Project
## Dublin Bus Travel Time Prediction Application

This project was developed during the summer research period of my MSc. This project was completed as part of a team consisting of myself, Claudia Kinsella, Aongus Bates and Chen Zeng. 

The application fulfills a number of functions in its operations:
-Analyses data consisting of the arrival times of buses at specific bus stops throughout Dublin.
-From this it displays selected information of the accompanying Google Map.
-Once the user has made their selections, the application outputs an estimation of the travel time between the two spots.
